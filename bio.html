  <h4>Who I Am</h4>
  <p>During normal duty hours, I am currently a United States Marine serving overseas and a college student - when I have time.  
    I am enrolled in University of Maryland University College.   I'm majoring in General Studies and planning of getting my 
    associates before I fly off to my next duty station.   I plan to tranfer and the reason why I'm taking college courses is 
    because frankly I have a lot of time on my hands.  Some day I would hope to travel the world.
</p>
  <h4>Where I Want to Visit</h4>
 <p>* Italy
* Greece
* Australia
* Turkey
* Egypt
* India
* France
* Switzlerland
* Sweden
* Romania
* United Kingdom
* Spain
* Israel
* Indonesia
* Netherlands
   
  </p>
  <h4>What Is My Purpose in Life</h4>
  <p>I think my purpose in life is to help people in poor countries.  We might not ever end world hunger, but if you can help 
    change someone's life and they help someone and be able to keep that cycle going, we can get very close.
